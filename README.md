My Repository
Hello, I am a research student working in the field of Ecology.
I am analyzing my metadata in qiime1, wherin i got stuck at the OTU-Picking step as it require server (which i currently don't have). Is there any alternative to complete this step on my PC (8GB RAM, 64bit OS, 2 cores, 4 processors)?
